# RESPONSIVE DESIGN

## Fluid Layout

- To allow webpage to adapdt to the currnet viewport width (or even height)
- Use % (or vh/ vw) unit instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport
- use max-width instead of widht

css properties: Float Layout, Flexbox✅, Grid✅

## Responsive Units

- Use rem instead of px for most lengths
- To make it easy tosacle the entire layout down (or up) automatically

## Flexiable image

- By default, images dont scale automatically as we change the viewport, so we need to fix that
- Always use % for image dimension, together wiwt max-width property

## Media Queri
