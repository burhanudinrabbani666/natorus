## 👐 Final Thoughts

Alhamdulillah, this project has been a great learning journey. I explored modern CSS techniques, built a clean and stylish introduction using **Sass**, and gained a clearer understanding of a **real-world CSS developer workflow**.

This project is not the end — it’s a foundation. In the future, I plan to:

- Revisit this project to add JavaScript for richer interactivity
- Expand it with new pages to further practice and refine my Sass skills
- Continue improving structure, performance, and maintainability

Every step here brought me closer to writing cleaner, more scalable front-end code. I’m excited to come back stronger and push this project even further 🚀.
