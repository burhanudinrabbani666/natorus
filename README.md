Natours is a fictional company website inspired by nature.

This repository was created as a learning space for CSS, with a primary focus on Sass (SCSS). It is part of my journey toward becoming a better Full Stack Developer, especially by strengthening my front-end styling skills.

All materials and implementations in this repository are based on courses I have taken on Udemy. This project is strictly for educational purposes and is not intended to claim ownership of any assets, designs, or learning materials related to the original course or the fictional website concept.

## Course Reference

The main course used as a learning resource:

- [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/?couponCode=CP250105G2)
